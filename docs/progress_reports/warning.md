The value of AE tokens could go to zero.
The software might have flaws that result in the value of tokens crashing.
The software is open source, anyone could launch a competitor that uses the same code. If this should happen, Aeternity could be worth less than the competitor.
I think that crowdsales are bad.
I disagree with how Aeternity spends money.
It is possible that Aeternity's leadership will waste all the money, and Aeternity will fall apart.
Aeternity's money is held by a multisig, it is possible that we lose the keys and the money becomes innaccessible. It is possible that some participants in the multisig steal the money. It is possible that a hacker finds out enough passwords to steal the money.
My health is bad, it is possible I will lose the ability to write software, and progress will stall.
It is possible that the Aeternity leadership decides not to use the software I wrote, AE might be on a blockchain that works completely different from what was expected.
It is possible that the Aeternity leadership decides to exclude me from Aeternity, there is no guarantee that I will be the one keeping the blockchain secure.
It is possible that the entire team could die in an accident, we often travel together.
There are competing oracle projects like Gnosis, Augur, and BitcoinHivemind. There is no guarantee that Aeternity will surpass the competition.
Aeternity keeps it's money in cryptocurrency, which is risky. It is possible that Aeternity will lose all it's money to market volatility, and we wont be able to fund development.
It is possible for Aeternity to fail in ways that I haven't predicted.


Use this software at your own risk.
Only invest money that you can afford to lose.
