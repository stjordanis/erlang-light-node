Amoveo Progress in March 2018

* Amoveo launched it's main net on March 2.

* the nodes crash significantly less often. Instead of 4x per day, now it is only once every 3 or 4 days.
This is because we fixed problems with pruning to recover disk space.

* the community expanded substantially. There are 16 live nodes all the time now.

* we now have a web page where you can see all the live full nodes in the network: http://veoscan.io/

* we now have a web page where you can see statistics related to how quickly blocks are being found. this is important for miners: https://jimhsu.github.io/amoveo-stats/

* 2 users besides Zack have successfully participated in the market contract inside the lightning network. We have begun making documentation to make this easier. This is Amoveo's killer app, so it is a good sign that people are starting to use it.

* We now have 4 mining pools operating for Amoveo.

* We have done 4 hard forks to fix issues in the software, including a hard fork to change the POW mining algorithm.
All these hard forks happened successfully without any issues.

* we now have a tool to look up the history of when a particular account gained or spend veo.

* we now have a tool to know which mining pool mined which block.

* tx handling is better, so the network doesn't drop txs any more.

* Simplified spending tokens from the light node.

* Updated the light node so you can run it alone without a full node.

* updated the light node so you can use it for cold storage. you can make unsigned txs, sign them, or publish them, all as different steps.

* Added more tools to the API for looking up the historical block times and historical hash rate.

* Now the exporer.html gives more information, like the current block period, and the current difficulty.

* Documentation for using oracles and governance mechanism improved substantially.

* we used the governance mechanism to raise and then lower the block reward.

* we now have a vanity address generator.

* The open source mining pool now uses shares, so you can get paid even if your miner isn't powerful enough to mine a full block.

* open source mining pool documentation has improved a lot.
