# Announcing an Amoveo testnet
### October 19, 2017



The launching of this testnet is a major milestone for Amoveo.

* the off-chain markets seem to be working.
* the consensus mechanism is fully optimized for light nodes.

I am searching for between 1 and 3 testers to help make the code better.
If you want to do this, you need to be
* comfortable typing commands into the terminal.
* able to explain the problems you encounter in clear english or spanish as a github issue at https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo
* be good at copy/pasting entire error messages.

If you try out the testnet, please attempt to use these parts, and make github issues about what goes wrong:

* syncing blocks
* mining
* creating and deleting accounts
* spending
* making channels
* closing channels in various ways
* The oracle
* channel payments
* channel bets
* channel bets via off-chain market

[Instructions to install the testnet are here](/README.md)

I want to know about anything that is uncomfortable or confusing.

I will consider paying any tester who is especially useful.

So far you need to use a text terminal in order to participate with the testnet, there is no gui interface. [Here is our roadmap, so you can see what will be made next](/docs/community_roadmap.md)
