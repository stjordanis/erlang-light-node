History of the invention of State Channels.

Zack started programming Channels July 2015

Zack invented the idea of state channels in August 2015
https://github.com/BumblebeeBat/FlyingFox/commit/5b229bc94e0623df4764fffc4ec2af2831b6ec1f#diff-4349690c4538ef9906e7e2776468470f

It took over a year of experiments for him to figure out how to build state channels so that they work well.
on October 2 2016 Zack understood channels as we are building them today, and he presented his results to the Blockchain community via forums and emails.

The idea was popular, and Jeff Coleman wrote his famous introduction to state channels a month later: http://www.jeffcoleman.ca/state-channels/

But, Jeff and the Ethereum community didn't yet completely understand Zack's message. The Ethereum community is aware that channels could store state for the blockchain to look at, but channels can do much more than that. Actually, as Zack realized in 2015, channels can have turing complete computation for smart contracts.
