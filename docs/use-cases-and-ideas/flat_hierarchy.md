Things like companies exist because they were recently the most efficient way for people to pool their resources and work together towards common goals at a certain scale, and because you need to be as big as a company to justify the cost of jumping through the regulatory loopholes.

Now that finance is unshackled from the government's restrictions, we have much better tools for pooling resources: unrestricted financial derivatives.

The biggest advantage of the new system over companies is that each individual is in complete control of their own money. We are entering the trustless era.

Lets look at the publishing industry for example. Under the old system you had a publishing company. They had a legal right to the book, and gave the author some money for every copy sold. The publishing company has investors who own it and trust managers to act wisely.
In the new system the book will be shared for free by torrent. The author will get paid before the book is published by an insured crowdfunding contract. No venture or company is involved.

Insured crowdfunding, which is a type of financial derivative, lets people pool their resources for common goals without trusting anyone. It allows us to pay for the production of goods or services without hiring anyone.

This is the perfect tool for paying for open-source software, for example. That way the money is coming directly from people who benefit from the code, and they each pay in proportion to how much the software benefits them. No company or venture needed.

Prediction markets allow us to come to consensus about how money should be spent without relying on a manager or company to make the decision.

When we do need a central leader, prediction markets can help us decide who is best to lead by giving us a prediction of the outcome of their leadership.
Prediction markets act as limitations on the choices available to leadership. A leader cannot act against the prediction market's instructions, it is political suicide.
