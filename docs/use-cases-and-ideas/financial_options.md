Options are a type of financial derivative where one party has the option but not the obligation to make a trade in the future.
Since one party doesn't have an obligation, they don't have to leave funds locked up in the channel for the duration of the contract. They can keep their money in Euros or Bitcoin or whatever they want, and only buy amoveo if they win the bet, to collect their winnings.

To do this, you agree to a channel contract that you don't have enough money in the channel to fullfil, then you do a channel-grow transaction type to grow the channel so that the channel contract becomes valid.
