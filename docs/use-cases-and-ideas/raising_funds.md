We can raise funds for public goods using this technology.
Unlike taxation, we don't use violence to raise funds. Amoveo doesn't cause anyone to over-pay.
Unlike donation, we don't suffer from tragedy of the commons. With Amoveo people who under-pay lose money, on average.
The most profitable strategy is to give almost as much money to the fundraiser as the public good will create for you.

So if we are using the dominant assurance contract to build a bridge over a river, and the bridge will make your restaurant worth $10,000 more, then the Nash equilibrium strategy for you is to give $10,000 to the contract.

Another way this technology can help is by revealing the lies the state tells us.
We can use prediction markets to get accurate predictions about the future.
We can know the correlation between events like, who gets elected, and what the GDP will be.
So we can know when the government makes promises it can't keep.

This technology can be used to insure against the state, which is equivalent to a bet that the government will grow.
This gives government people the option to make a bet that government will shrink, and since they have the power to make the government shrink, they will.

It is a peaceful, voluntary, incentive compatible way to dismantle the state.
