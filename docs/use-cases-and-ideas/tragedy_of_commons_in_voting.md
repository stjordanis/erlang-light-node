If you own 1/100 of all the voting tokens, then you would have 1% of the voting power.
For example, you are voting on something like:

A) everyone keeps their own money

B) update the code to give all the money to the attacker

If the community is not bribed, they will vote for A. That way they don't lose their funds.

How much do you need to be bribed to vote for A?

We make a square showing how much money you could get in each of the 4 outcomes, then calculate how big the bribe has to be to make it profitable for you to vote for B.

If A is the outcome, you get 1/100 of the tokens back that were already yours.
If you participate in the attack, you get the bribe, and you lose (value of your tokens)*(probability that your vote was pivotal).

By "pivotal" I mean that your vote changed the outcome from A to B.

The bribe only has to be as big as (value of your tokens)*(probability that your vote is pivotal)
Even worse, the bribe can be conditional. So the attacker only has to pay the bribe if the attack fails.
If the attack succeeds, then the attacker gets all the money on the blockchain, and doesn't have to pay any bribes.

We can estimate the probability that your vote is pivotal by the portion of coins you own. So the total bribe to make you vote for B is 1/10000 of the tokens, which is just 1% of the amount of tokens you own.
