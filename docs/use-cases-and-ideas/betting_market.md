Comparing Amoveo with other centralized Sports Betting Websites
========

A centralized betting server is expensive for a mixture of reasons:

1) The people running the market can run off with all the money on the server at any time. This risk increases the average expected cost of using the market.
2) There is a cost to regulatory overhead. To pay the regulators to audit the market, and pay enforcers to catch and punish any criminal behavior. 

Costs, whether they come from (1) or (2), eventually have to be put onto the users in the form of fees.

Usually these 2 types of costs come as a trade-off. If (1) is worse, then (2) is not as bad. If (2) is worse, then (1) is not as bad. Amoveo is more affordable to use because we completely solve (1) and (2) at the same time.

So a market secured by Amoveo will be more affordable to use in comparison to unsecured markets and markets secured by government enforced law.
