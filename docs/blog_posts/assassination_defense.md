Assassination markets are coming.
We can prevent them from happening on Amoveo, but we cannot prevent someone from launching a new blockchain dedicated to this purpose.

This is a list of survival strategies to help you avoid being assassinated.

1) avoid being famous.
2) avoid positions of power where if you died someone else would replace you.
3) don't give large inheritances.
4) don't do anything that could cause a company or wealthy individual to lose a lot of money.
5) If you need to store secrets, consider connecting them to a dead man's switch. So if you die, they all become public.
6) avoid being an important part of a business, if that business has rivals.
7) use different names for each place you go to, and each website you use.
8) Share login id/password with multiple people, so if one of you dies, the online identity does not die.
9) Some assassins try to kill just for the reputation, so they can get more jobs later. Avoid being an easy target for this. Also, avoid being an especially difficult target. Assassins might go after difficult targets for the extra reputation.
10) get a carbon monoxide detector. Hide it very well. Make sure your house is well ventalated.
11) don't leave your car in place where it could be booby trapped.
12) if you use uber, always double-check that the correct driver arrived to pick you up.
13) instruct your friends and family that if you should die, it should be kept secret for long enough that any assassination markets would expire without knowing about your death. I recommend at least 12 months, but even 1 month is better than nothing.
14) Don't do racist/sexist/nationalist things on video. Don't write things like this. Even if it is a joke, do not do this.


Here is some reasoning for why you should _not_ use an assassination market.
If you have a bad boss, then you can use a prediction market to show how your bad boss is hurting the company. This is called futarchy. With Futarchy you earn a profit for providing good information. If you use an assassination market, you lose money to pay for the assassination.
If you use Futarchy you can avoid legal risks, you can avoid the risk that someone will want revenge, and you can avoid collateral damage. Even if this person is a bad boss to you, they might also be a good parent to their child. They might be important to their spouse. If someone dies, it impacts everyone around them.
