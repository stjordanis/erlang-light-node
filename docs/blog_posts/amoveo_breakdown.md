Amoveo Breakdown

(based on a blog post by Josh Deane)

The Trustless, Decentralized and Purely Functional Oracle Machine

In the last month, Amoveo's market cap has increased more than 3x.

Now given this information, what has enabled this to perform while BTC or other Top Alt.Coins have seen a “decrease” or — better stated — calmed down a bit from the late 2017 Bull Run? Well, let’s dive into their WhitePaper and agenda:

Pulled directly from a WhitePaper written about Amoveo, the abstract states, “We present a highly scalable blockchain architecture with a consensus mechanism which is also used to check the oracle. This makes the oracle very efficient because it avoids layering one consensus mechanism on top of another. State channels are integrated to increase privacy and scalability. Tokens in channels can be transferred using purely functional smart contracts that can access Oracle answers. By not storing contract code or state on-chain, we can make smart contracts easier to analyze and faster to process, with no substantial loss in de facto functionality”.

This WhitePaper then goes to address the three “core” problems that we intend on addressing or better creating/building upon. 1: The prevailing stateful design makes smart contracts written for the platform hard to analyze. 2. the high cost of bringing real-world data into the system in a decentralized, trustless and reliable way complicates or outright prevents the realization of many promising applications. 3. The platforms are limited in their abilities to update themselves, to adapt to new technological or economic knowledge. Again, this information is what we can “better build upon”; in regards to the lack of scalability, scripting safety, and cheap access to smart contract platforms.

Now, you may still be questioning their use-case, so let’s try to better understand this information. Amoveo can more easily be described as an open source, digital asset, and (distributing) computing blockchain platform that builds upon decentralization. A few of the more prominent distinctions that Amoveo is offering (IMO) is:

The Strong Focus on Scalability: Amoveo attempts to offer better transaction speed and immediate verification through a consensus protocol. This is done so while keeping smart contracts off of the blockchain. For example, the focus of state channels is what they believe can better increase speed and efficiency, while at the same time occurring off of the blockchain and create more privacy for all users.
Information Gateways (Oracles): Amoveo attempts to interface with, and feed data from the real world (Potential catalyst to mass adoption — many cryptocurrencies are closed systems). (Retrieved from: https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeternity)
Overall, the most efficient or innovative tasks that are attempted to be better established are state channels, and the transactions occur off the blockchain, decentralized oracles, and their applications (Apps).
