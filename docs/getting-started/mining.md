There are 3 pieces of software you might want to install:

* amoveo full node
* a miner, like the c-miner or the opencl-miner, or the miner that Mandel wrote.
* a mining pool


If you are going to connect to someone elses mining pool, then the only software you need is the miner.


If you are going to use more than one miner, you need to connect them to a mining pool. don't connect them to your full node directly. If one is connected directly to the full node, it will repeated refresh the problem being worked on, so the other node's work would be wasted.

If the miner is on a different computer from the full node, then you need a mining pool.

If you use a mining pool, it must be on the same computer as the full node.
