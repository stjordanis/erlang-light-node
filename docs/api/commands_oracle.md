The terminal interface to the oracle
=============


New question oracle
====
This oracle asks a true/false question about the future. Eventually, the answer to this question will get recorded on the oracle, and will be accessible to the smart contracts.
```
OID = api:new_question_oracle(Start, Question).
```
This returns the OID, which is necessary for making markets.

New governance oracle
====
This oracle updates the variables that define the blockchain protocol. 
```
OID = api:new_governance_oracle(GovName, GovAmount).
```
This returns the OID for this oracle.

You can look up current governance values like this:
```
trees:get(governance, GovName).
```

See all oracles where betting has started, and betting has not yet finished.
====
```
oracles:ready_for_bets().
```
returns a list like [{Question1, Oracle1}, {Question2, Oracle2}...].


See all oracles where it is possible to close the oracle.
====
```
oracles:ready_to_close().
```
returns a list like [{Question1, Oracle1}, {Question2, Oracle2}...].


See all existing oracles
====

```
oracles:all().
```
returns a list like [{Question1, Oracle1}, {Question2, Oracle2}...].
You can use this to find out the OID for an oracle.

look up an oracle by id
=====
```
trees:get(oracles, ID).
```

The order of things stored in the oracle datastructure is defined in [the records.hrl file](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/apps/amoveo_core/src/records.hrl#L62)

Bet in an oracle
====
type is one of the atoms in this list: [true, false, bad]
You can either bet that the answer to the question is true or false, or you can bet that it is a bad question.
```
api:oracle_bet(OracleID, Type, Amount).

```
Type is either 1, 2, or 3.
1 = true
2 = false
3 = bad question

Look up unmatched bets in the oracle
====
```
api:orders(OracleID).
```

Close an oracle
====
If the oracle has had the same output state for a long enough period of time, then this is how anyone can close the channel and end the betting period.
```
api:oracle_close(OracleID).
```

Oracle Shares
====
Collect shares purchased in an oracle
```
api:oracle_winnings(OracleID).
```

Oracle unmatched
====
If you had unmatched trades sitting in the order book when the oracle closed, this is how you get your money back.
```
api:oracle_unmatched(OracleID).
```


Creating a scalar oracle
====
A scalar oracle is actually multiple binary oracles. Each one is for 1 bit of the scalar value.
Many is how many bits make up the scalar value. set it to 10 for now.
set OID to be a random 32-byte value. This will be the ID of the 0th bit. the next oracles will occur at OID+1, OID+2...
```
api:new_scalar_oracle(Start, Question, OID, Many).
```
Use api:oracle_bet and api:oracle_close to close each of the 10 oracles. then use api:oracle_winnings and api:oracle_unmatched to get your money back out of them.
