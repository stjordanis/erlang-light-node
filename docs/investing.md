I don't want to spend your money for you.

Amoveo will have miners, so if you want to invest you could mine Amoveo.
Amoveo will also have smart contracts that could be profitable. If you want to invest you could make some smart contracts.
Amoveo will need nodes to be the hubs for the hub-and-spoke lightning network. If you want to invest, you could operate these nodes.
Amoveo software development will be funded by dominant assurance contracts, so people who want to invest could participate in those.
