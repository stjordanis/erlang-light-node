Binary Bet
=======

A binary bet is one where one of the two parties ends up winning all the money from the contract.
To make a binary contract, you need to connect to a binary oracle.

Caution, each of the 10 bits of a scalar oracle is actually a binary oracle, so don't make a bet on the first bit of a scalar oracle, thinking it is a binary oracle.
