Oracle ID
=========

An Oracle ID or OID is a short binary value used to identify an Oracle.
Both binary and scalar oracles have OIDs.
If you want to make a contract that references an oracle, you need to write that oracle's OID into the contract.

We often encode OIDs into base64 when we want to copy/paste them.
