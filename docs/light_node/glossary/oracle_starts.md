Oracle Starts
===========

This is the earliest date at which people can start reporting to the oracle mechanism. It is measured by the block height.

If you want to bet on a football game, you should find out a date and time when you are certain that the result of the game will be known. Figure out what the Amoveo block height will be at that time.

For example, there are currently 130 blocks per day, and we are at block height 55000. So, in 3 days, we will be at block 55390.
So if I wanted to bet on a football game that I was sure would end 3 days, then I should use "55390" for the oracle starts variable.
