Financial derivatives are a big part of the economy, and they will continue getting bigger.
=====
- hedging against risk.
  - as economy grows, so do risks that we want to hedge.
- selling information.
  - as science improves, there are more and more opportunities to learn valuable facts.
  - people use financial derivatives to sell the valuable facts they learn with science.

for financial derivatives, blockchain is a better platform than centralized institutions.
=====
- Financial derivatives today are expensive because of trusted third parties fees and the cost of regulatory compliance.
  - blockchains enable financial derivatives without having to trust a third party. So we don't have to pay a fee to any trusted third party.
  - blockchains enable us to circumvent regulatory compliance costs.

Putting financial derivatives onto blockchains is ethically good. Programmable financial derivatives allows us to:
=====
- determine the truth and identify liars.
  - identify which scientific papers are lying.
  - identify which of a politician's campaign promises are lies.
- expose corruption and bribery.
- expose workplace abuse.
- expose racist or sexist employment practices.
- expose the true value of someone's employment, so you can know your worth and request more raises.
- raise money for public goods in an economically efficient manner, and without resorting to violence.

Amoveo is the best blockchain platform for financial derivatives
=====
- We move the financial derivatives contracts into the lightning network
  - This way trades don't get recorded in blocks
  - improves scalability
  - improves privacy
  - lowers trading cost
  - makes participation in smart contracts as fast as pinging a server.
  - writing secure contracts is easier when there is no on-chain state to worry about. smart contracts in the lightning network are practically pure functions.
  - Writing new smart contracts and updating old contracts is cheaper, because you don't have to pay to publish them on-chain.
- oracle
  - mechanism to teach the blockchain true facts, that way it can judge the results of contracts.
  - combines Nakamoto consensus with a betting market for escalation.
  - our oracle is orders of magnitude more affordable.
  - does not rely on any cryptoeconomically insecure mechanism, like voting.
- light nodes
  - Amoveo is designed for light nodes, the light nodes are even more secure than bitcoin light nodes.
    - blocks include a merkel root of the merkel proofs you would need to process that block, so if someone tries to cheat by editing history, the proof that they cheated is always very small.
  - you can participate in financial derivatives and all other smart contracts using Amoveo's light nodes.
  - Amoveo has a light node in javascript, making it easy for anyone to participate in Amoveo smart contracts.
