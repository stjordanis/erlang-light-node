Volatility
============

Cryptocurrency is very volatile. This means that the price of cryptocurrency changes a lot from one day to the next.

Volatility is a bad thing. It increases the risk of holding the currency.

For financial markets, volatility is an especially bad thing. Higher volatility increases the cost of leaving money locked in a contract because it increases the risk that the value of the tokens locked in the contract will fall significantly.

Why does volatility happen?
=============

There are different kinds of traders. Some types tend to ignore market trends, and focus on the technology.
If some new technology is created in a competitor, or a security vulnerability is discovered, then the technology focused investors may all leave at once.

Other traders see it as a thrilling way to gamble. These types of investors are probably the worst. They contribute to volatility because they tend to get involved only when the price is rising, and then they suddenly all leave when the price is falling.

Some traders see the blockchain as a community to participate in. These traders don't focus on technology too much, but are highly sensitive to popularity and coolness.
If something uncool happens to a blockchain, then these investors may leave all at once.

And there are other kinds of traders too.

If too many traders on a blockchain are using the same strategy, that is not good.
If you own coins on a blockchain where everyone else is using the same trading strategy as you, then the price will fall right when you want to sell, and rise right when you want to buy.
You will do much better on a blockchain where more people are using different strategies from you.

How can we avoid volatility?
=======

1) We need a diversity of investors, from different places, speaking different languages, and with different levels of technical knowledge.

2) We should avoid inviting people into the community if they are a bad investor. Like a thrill-seeking gambler for example.

3) We should maintain a futures market for the price of the currency, that way users have more time to coordinate on a price for each moment in time, so we have a better prediction of the future price. Amoveo already supports this.

4) We should grow the market cap as much as possible. Amoveo's block reward is set by a governance system. So Amoveo can change the rate of coin production to match the rate of community growth. This has the benefit that Amoveo's market cap can grow more quickly. But this comes at the cost that Amoveo's tokens won't increase in value as quickly.

5) We should have "stable coins", or insurance contracts to protect you from Amoveo losing too much value relative to the USD or gold or whatever. Amoveo already supports binary markets, which can be used by a determined investor to make stable coins.
