Hi I worked on proof of stake for more than a year. You can see on my github my many failed attempts. https://github.com/zack-bitcoin Flying Fox, PinkFairy, Slasher. Each of which had many revisions before they were abandoned. I also built the proof of stake parts of the Amoveo blockchain which is in development.

I lived with Jae Kwon of Tendermint/Cosmos for a couple months. His project is cool, but he makes a design decision which I dislike. I still think his project can be successful, and make lots of money. It is a massive improvement on popular financial tools like SWIFT. Some of the users in Cosmos are part of a powerful set that runs the consensus. Everyone else is a second-class citizen. Using soft-forks, it seems that the powerful class of users can change the consensus rules in any way they want.

I am impressed with the work on Ethereum casper. I used their ideas when designing the oracle for Amoveo. The Amoveo oracle is a kind of proof of stake consensus mechanism. I think Casper will be a secure consensus mechanism for blockchains.

There is a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of mining. Proof of stake can work, but it wont improve the blockchain at all, and has the potential to make it worse.

Our economy is always growing, there will always be demand for more liquid money.

Mining is a mechanism for converting illiquid electricity and computers into liquid money.

Since mining, as a side effect, gives our blockchain security, it really doesn't make sense to waste our time finding alternatives for security. Even if the blockchain didn't use mining for security, it would still need to have the same amount of mining.


When governments print money at no cost, yes it causes inflation which is bad.

When miners mine gold at high cost, it doesn't cause inflation the same way. As soon as the price of gold goes down, some miners become unprofitable and mining decreases too. In a natural equilibrium.

Mining allows us to walk the middle path between two ways to fail:

1) money can be printed at too low a cost = inflation

2) money can't be printed at a low enough cost = stagnation in the growth of the network


Bitcoin is on autopilot. Sometimes the reward is too high, other times it is too low. It only ends up on the middle path occasionally at random.

In Amoveo there is a governance mechanism, so the community can update the block reward to stay on the middle path.

You are correct that censorship is a big problem for proof of stake. I am not sure if it can be solved, but even if it was solved, I don't think POS will be popular.

A major benefit of POW style mining over virtual mining is that POW's costs are external to the network. We have a ton of resources on this planet that can be transformed into cryptocurrency. Sunlight, oil, nuclear power, geothermal. This is a quick and efficient way to grow the network.

In POS virtual mining the rate of mining is limited by the market cap of the currency, this limit on the rate of mining may force us onto the stagnation path. Decreasing supply necessarily increases price. If the demand for new tokens it too high, then POS-virtual-mined blockchains will be on the stagnation path. It costs too much to mine.

Another problem with virtual miners is that locking up money directly decreases the utility of the network. It is better to turn our planets resources into money instead of cannibalizing our own system.
