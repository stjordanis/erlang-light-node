There are some companies that specialize in manufacturing slabs of silicon ASIC. each slab gets chopped up into many individual chips.
Working with one of these companies directly to produce a full slab would cost around $1,000,000.
Once we know what we want to build, we could do something like this.

But first we should work with some different companies.
These companies buy up lots of space on a silicon slab, and then they resell it in smaller amounts to people like us.
In this way we could purchase a small part of a slab, to have 1 or 2 individual ASICS made. This is how we test our software to make sure it works correctly.
I am guessing this will cost us around $10,000

Finally, there is the software. I have never written code in Verilog or VHDL, and I have heard that hiring people for this sort of development can be very expensive.
Luckily our algorithm is very short. Our chip will use about 1/4 as many circuits as bitcoin ASICS for example.
I guess we could hire someone to do the software for $20,000

For all these things, if we spend more time shopping around we can find better deals.
