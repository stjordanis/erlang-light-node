Hedging risk is Decentralized Decision Making
==============


How do communities come to a decision when there is no central authority to force the decision upon them?

A simple example with a small number of people, Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
Alice, Bob and Charlie have been doing survival strategy A, but Alice wants the three to try survival strategy B instead.
Bob and Charlie don't understand B, and don't want to risk their time on something that wont work.

Alice bets 4 days of food that survival strategy B will be more effective.
Bob and Charlie each bet 2 days of food that survival strategy B will be less effective.

Now Bob and Charlie are willing to try out strategy B for 2 days.
This is because their risks are hedged.
If strategy B fails, then they win their bets and are hedged.
If strategy B succeeds, then they have a new more effective survival strategy and are all better off.
No matter what the result, they end up better off for having participated in strategy B for a couple days.

As long as they have a way to trade risk together, then Alice, Bob, and Charlie can come to agreement about how to invest their effort as a team, and they don't need any central authority to force a decision upon them. 

Once their risks are hedged, then their incentives are aligned, they all have 100% consensus in that they all want the same things to happen.
This is how Alice, Bob, and Charlie can overcome politics, and put their full effort into the task at hand.

This ancient method for communities to make decisions is a version of what is today called "futarchy". This has been an important part of what it means to be human since before written history. It allowed us to cooperate, and colonize our entire planet.


This method of decision making can be scaled up for communities of any scale, including the global community.
For example, if your country is having trouble impeaching their president, we could make a market allowing anyone to bet on whether the president will get impeached.
People who would benefit from the impeachment could bet on "no", to hedge their risk that he will get impeached.
People who would take a loss from the impeachment could bet on "yes", to hedge their risk that he wont get impeached.

If the amount of benefit due to impeachment is greater than the amount of loss due to impeachment, then the people betting on "no" will become fully hedged before the people betting on "yes".
At that point, the country will have zero people who are against impeachment. Even the president being impeached could hedge their risks in the market, and wouldn't care either way about impeachment.
This is how we can overcome politics, and put our full effort into the task at hand.


Amoveo is a blockchain that allows futarchy at any scale, and you don't need anyone's permission to use it to bet on anything you want.
