The long-term goal is to fund Amoveo development using [insured crowdfunding](../use-cases-and-ideas/insured_crowdfund.md)
This is an ideal way to protect the project from being controlled by a centralized team of developers.

The short-term strategy to fund Amoveo development needs to be a little different.

For now Zack has an excessive amount of knowledge of the project in comparison to everyone else. So it is important that the developer reward is set up so that Zack has an incentive to work on Amoveo.
No one will want to invest in Amoveo if they think it is in Zack's interest to abandon it.

Insured crowdfunding will be great eventually, but for now the 2nd layer tools, including the amoveo insured crowdfunding smart contract, are all crude and imprecise.
At the beginning there will be few tokens, so there wont be enough liquidity for the insured crowdfunding contract.
Insured crowdfunding only works to raise money for something that doesn't exist yet. Not for something that already exists. So we can't use insured crowdfunding to pay Zack for work he already did.

Instead we will use something similar to the Zcash developer reward.
In Zcash 20% of every block goes to the development team.

In Amoveo the block reward and developer reward are 2 independent values controlled by the governance mechanism. So at any time, the community could decide to change how much they pay Zack.

Additionally, the developer reward will be unspendable for the first 6 months or so.
If Zack can't keep the blockchain alive that long, then he doesn't get paid at all.
