Why _not_ to buy or mine Amoveo tokens.

Amoveo has the potential to earn us all a lot of money.

In investing, the potential to earn profit is always in proportion to how high the risk is. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying to you.
[Amoveo is a very high risk project.](../warning.md)
I estimate there is a >3/4 chance that Amoveo will break in the first 3 months and we will all lose everything. [developers also wont get paid](developer_reward.md).
If this happens, we will fix the software, and we will launch it again.

If you insist on investing in Amoveo, then I recommend only doing it with small amounts of money. So if Amoveo breaks, it will not be a disaster for you, and you will be able to afford to participate in the next Amoveo blockchain, if you choose.
