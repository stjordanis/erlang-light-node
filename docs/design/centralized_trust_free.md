Centralized but Trust Free
=======

Decentralization means taking a process that used to depend on the existence of some centralized authority, and you change the rules so that anyone can participate in any role. So there is no longer any centralized authority upon whom the process depends.
Decentralization is an important part of what make blockchains work. Blockchains need to be decentralized, because it needs to be impossible for anyone to shut the blockchain off.

Decentralization has been over-hyped lately. People are trying to use decentralization in situations that do not require it.

Decentralization is very expensive, it should only be used when it is needed.
If a blockchain has pieces that are unnecessarily decentralized, it will make it more expensive to use that blockchain.
A blockchain that unnecessarily decentralizes pieces will have high fees compared to a blockchain which uses decentralization only where necessary.

Many times, when people seek decentralization, what they should be seeking is trust-free relationships.
A trust-free relationship with a central authority is secure the same way a decentralized relationship is secure.
A trust-free relationship only depends on hiring a single authority to support you.
If that single authority should disappear, or break any rules, then you would automatically get a refund.
This is much more affordable than hiring multiple people in a decentralized network and coordinating their efforts.

Amoveo's market is centralized and trust-free.
Trading happens between individual traders, and individual market makers.
This makes it much more affordable to participate in the market.
