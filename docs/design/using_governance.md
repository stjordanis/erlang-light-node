The oracle only works to report things that are already common knowledge.
The oracle has 2 major limitations from making it an effective tool for making decisions:
* When you use the on-chain oracle, you can make different bets on each side of a fork.
* Nakamoto consensus is optimizing for maximum hash rate, which is often contradictory with the goal of a large market cap.

Luckily, Amoveo has scalable markets for derivatives, which are an ideal tool for communities to make decisions.
We should use amoveo futarchy markets to make the decision, and then use the governance mechanism to report the communities choice to the blockchain.
