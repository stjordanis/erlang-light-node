Amoveo wants to have ASICS for mining as soon as possible.

GPU are bad for mining because the demand curve looks like a step-function.
If Amoveo is 1% more profitable than the alternatives, then we get the majority of the miners.
If Amoveo is 1% less profitable than the alternatives, then all the miners leave.


In order for retargetting to work, we need the demand curve to increase smoothly as the price goes down.

If we want a stable blocktime, then retargetting needs to work.

In order to maintain the rate of production of new VEO, we need a stable blocktime.



ASICS don't suffer the same problem as GPU. You can't re-use ASICS to mine on a different blockchain. Each ASIC is specialized for only one blockchain.
So if we use ASICS, then the demand curve will increase smoothly as the price goes down.

So with ASICS we can have a stable blocktime, which means that we can maintain the rate of production of VEO using the governance mechanism.
