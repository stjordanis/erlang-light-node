Aeternity is a Scam
25 July 2018

Originally AE was going to launch in April 2018.
Currently they say they will launch in July or August.
At this point they don't have time to implement any major features, so we can compare Aeternity's promises with what they have actually built.

You can tell AE is a scam by counting up all the lies on their home page. https://aeternity.com/

Looking at the stuff under "Why is Aeternity so innovative?", I can count 14 unique lies, and 7 repeats of lies.

Smart contracts -
1) This is not innovative, they are copying EVM and solidity from Ethereum.
After searching their codebase, the only VM they have written is EVM.
2) Varna does not exist.
3) FTWVM does not exist.
4) Channel smart contracts do not exist in AE.

Consensus - Aeternity uses a voting based system from BitShares. Unlike bitshares, Aeternity does not use voting for blockchain consensus. Instead it is used to update certain system parameters. 
Lots of lies from AE:
5) delegated voting isn't innovative, since bitshares did it already.
6) block consensus in AE is POW, not POS. 
7) Voting is proven to be cryptoeconomically insecure for making decisions.

State channels - Aeternity has written a lot of code that is labeled "state channels", but in actuality they have only created payment channels. 
Aeternity channels are not capable of participating in off-chain markets, which is a critical security feature of any state channel system. Without off-chain markets, state channels cannot be used to trustlessly participate in smart contracts. https://twitter.com/zack_bitcoin/status/1021204268215427073
Without smart contracts, state channels are identical to payment channels.
Therefore, ae is only creating payment channels, not state channels.
* state channels aren't innovative, Amoveo already has them.
* AE cannot execute smart contracts off-chain. It does not have state channels.
8) turing complete state channels is not innovative, Amoveo did it first.

Oracles - Aeternity uses trusted feeds for oracles. This is identical to using services like bitrated as an arbiter for bitcoin.
9) This is not innovative.
10) Trusting some arbiter or group of arbiters for your contract is not trustless. It is not a cyptoeconomically secure oracle.

Unique Governance - Aeternity uses a voting based system from Bitshares.
11) They already advertised this feature as "Consensus", which was misleading. Now they are advertising it as "Unique Governance" which is also misleading.
* It is not unique or innovative, it is copied from bitshares.
* Voting is proven to be cryptoeconomically insecure for making decisions. 

Naming system -
12) This is not innovative, Namecoin did this in 2015.

Privacy - Aeternity claims that it can offer more privacy by allowing for contracts off-chain inside of turing complete state channels.
* AE doesn't have off-chain contracts. it only has payment channels.
* State channels are not innovative, Amoveo had them first.

Security - Aeternity is using POW blockchain technology. Just like thousands of other blockchains.
13) POW blockchains is not an innovation. Satoshi invented POW blockchains.

Low Cost - Aeternity claims that state channels will be the default way to run smart contracts.
* This is a lie since they only support payment channels, not state channels.
14) "Aeternity is the most efficient turing complete blockchain", this is a lie. the EVM in Aeternity is much slower than the one in Geth. Amoveo's turing complete state channels cost 0 gas, since the computation is off-chain, so Amoveo is infinitely more efficient.


## Conclusions

AE software is a non-compatible rewrite of Ethereum into Erlang.
This wouldn't a problem, if they honestly advertised it as such.
What makes Aeternity a scam is the fact that they advertise themselves as something different than what they are.

This is a problem for Amoveo, because Aeternity is advertising itself as an improved version of Amoveo. 

Maybe this happens because Aeternity raised money by promising to build what Amoveo is now, and they are worried about the legal consequences of admitting that they will not fulfill those promises.

Maybe this happens because no one at Aeternity understands what promises they are making. They advertise themselves as whatever gets the most attention, even if they don't understand what they are promising.

Maybe this happens because of miscommunication between the advertising and programming branches of AE.
The advertisers just copy/paste words without understanding. The programmers keep changing the scope of the project without explaining to the advertisers what has changed.

Maybe this happens because the leadership at AE is trying to harm Amoveo.
